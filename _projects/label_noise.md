name: Paraphrase Detection with Label Noise Analysis
tools: [Python, NLP, Research]
description: In this project, we analyze the impact of label noise on the performance of the paraphrase detection model. i.e. We will analyse the sensitivity to label noise (robustness) in our paraphrase detection model.
