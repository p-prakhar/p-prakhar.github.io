<p><em>The true motto of IIT Guwahati - achieving excellence through the amalgamation of the mind, heart, and body - is brilliantly exhibited through the myriad extracurricular, sports, and leadership roles undertaken by the students, in addition to a strenuous academic schedule.</em> Students show intense time-management, intrapersonal, interpersonal as well as managerial and leadership skills as they take up versatile roles, such as managing the student body, organizing international festivals, competing fiercely in prestigious national and international competitions, and taking up social initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Student Gymkhana Council</strong></p>
<p>The Students' Gymkhana Council is the body that promotes the objectives of fostering extra-curricular and co-curricular activities and welfare of the students during their stay on the campus. <em>Being in the Gymkhana council enhances a student's leadership and managerial skills.</em></p>
<p><strong>Inter-Hostel Events</strong></p>
<p>Fierce competition exists amongst the residents of the 10 hostels of IIT Guwahati, which is exhibited during the inter-hostel technical, sports, and cultural festivals leading up to the overall championship. Students are thus provided with ample opportunities to nurture and develop their team-bonding and interpersonal skills. <em>Major inter-hostel events:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Manthan (Cultural)</em></li>
<li><em>Spardha (Sports)</em></li>
<li><em>Kriti (Technical)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sports and Inter IIT</strong></p>
<p>The institute is well equipped with training infrastructure for major outdoor and indoor sports including football, hockey, basketball, body-building, cricket, volleyball, lawn tennis, athletics, badminton, squash, swimming, and more. Students work rigorously all year-round for the Inter-IIT sports meet held in December every year. IITG students have exemplary records in these events and in several national level sports competitions. Such training and rigor helps students develop a mindset to persevere and to have a hunger to excel.</p>
<p><strong>Clubs</strong></p>
<p>Imperative to promoting co-curricular activities, the 30+ active clubs of IIT Guwahati provide stimulus and order for growth and experience in cultural, technical, sports, and entrepreneurship. The sheer variety of clubs leads to a well-rounded, versatile, and passionate persona of an IITG student.</p>
<p><strong>Student Organized Fests</strong></p>
<p>Each year, the students organize three major international festivals in the field of culture, technology, and entrepreneurship. The organizing teams of these festivals showcase immense planning, coordination, and marketing skills. The entire festivals are run and managed by students and serve as great lessons in developing communication, crowd and risk management, and leadership skills.</p>
